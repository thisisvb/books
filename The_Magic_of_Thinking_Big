Summary: This books talk about how to change your thinking to a winning mind set.

1] The most important aspect is to BELIEVE IN YOUR SELF. Success starts with this.
2] Believing in yourself is different from wishful thinking. The latter just means you "wish" for great things to happen.
3] Believing in your self means you have the courage, commitment, dedication to work hard to achieve the things you set out to achieve.
4] Think positive always. Don't think negative.
5] Always think of the positive outcome. Always say I CAN AND I WILL. This triggers a chain reaction and your body and mind will do things to make sure you get there.
6] Eliminate the "excucitis" disease. Don't give excuses for not doing things. It's all in your mind. You control your life.
7] Don't think of negative outcomes.
8] For example, when applying to a job - Don't think of all the reasons you can fail and how you are not qualified for the role. Instead think that this job is made for you, believe in your self and your ability to get this job. Work hard, make the appropriate connents, prepare and go get that job! Think winning, think success.
9] Think success. Nothing more satisfying than knowing you're on path to becoming successful.
10] To think confidently, act confidently.
11] Remind yourself that you're better than who you think you are!
